    <br>
    Animal cruelty includes a wide range of detrimental acts against animals, ranging from neglect to intentional slaughter. Intentional cruelty can range from intentionally denying an animal of food, water, shelter, socializing, or veterinary treatment to torturing, maiming, mutilating, or murdering an animal.</p>

      Ignorance regarding ethical and adequate animal care is fairly frequent, as is neglect, a fundamental degree of callousness towards animals as sentient beings. as a sort of entertainment or "shock value" popular among teenagers.
      Animal neglect occurs when the animal's caretaker or owner fails to provide adequate food, water, shelter, or veterinary treatment for the animal's survival. Long periods of neglect might result in major health problems or even death.

        Passing of the Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Bill means maximum sentences for animal cruelty offences have been increased from six months to five years. Animal welfare charities have welcomed a new piece of legislation that means those found guilty of animal cruelty offences could face up to five years in prison.</p>
