    <p class="space"> With this project, we hope to clear the streets of roaming animals and animals that are being abused. We mostly target the animals that are looking for a home/ safe haven and people that are willing to take care of the animals and looking for a companion in animal form. We hope that this will help the animals that have no home and for the people that dislike seeing animals on the streets.

    <p class="space a"> I am a student at one of the top schools in Barbados, I really love animals which lead me to create this service for animals that have nowhere to call home/ safe haven. I hated to see animals roaming the streets looking for a place to sleep and something to eat it hurts to see them that way so I decided that would help in my own way even if it didnâ€™t result in much. These animals have been abandoned and abused these videos tells us that there are animals out there in the world suffering.</p>
